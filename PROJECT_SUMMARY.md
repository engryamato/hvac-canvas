## ✅ Phase B: Measurements (COMPLETE)

### Feature 2: Scale Management ✅
**Implementation:**
- Type system: `Scale`, `ScaleUnit`, `ScaleType`
- Predefined scales database:
  - **Architectural:** 6 scales (1/16"=1'-0" to 1"=1'-0")
  - **Engineering:** 6 scales (1"=10' to 1"=60')
  - **Metric:** 8 scales (1:1 to 1:500)
- Conversion helpers: `pixelsToInches()`, `formatLength()`
- Default scale: 1:1 (1 pixel = 1 inch)

**Length Formatting:**
- **Imperial:** `16'-8"` (feet and inches)
- **Metric:** `5.2 m` or `52.4 cm`

## ✅ Phase C: UI Enhancement (COMPLETE)

### Feature 3: Collapsible Sidebar ✅
**Implementation:**
- Flex layout: canvas (flex-1) + sidebar (320px)
- Sidebar collapse state with toggle function
- Full-height toggle button (24px wide, 100vh)
- Dynamic width adjustment
- Canvas auto-resizes when sidebar toggles

**Sidebar Structure:**
- Header: "Line Summary" + current scale
- Content area: Table or empty state
- Toggle button: Chevron icons (left/right)

### Feature 4: Line Summary Table ✅
**Implementation:**
- `LineSummaryRow` type with count, size, total length, line IDs
- `calculateLineSummary()` function with `useMemo` optimization
- Real-time updates on add/delete/modify
- Professional styling with hover effects

**Table Columns:**
1. **Count:** Number of lines with this width
2. **Size:** Width in inches (e.g., "8\"")
3. **Total Length:** Sum of lengths (e.g., "28'-6\"")

**Features:**
- Groups lines by width
- Sorts by width (ascending)
- Updates automatically
- Empty state: "No lines drawn yet"

---

## ✅ Phase D: Quality Assurance (COMPLETE)

### Feature 6: Comprehensive Testing ✅
**Test Suite:** `tests/drawing-canvas.spec.ts`

**17 Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Application loads with sidebar visible
2. ✅ Sidebar collapse/expand functionality
3. ✅ Draw mode enable/disable with button
4. ✅ Draw mode toggle with D key
5. ✅ Click-click drawing interaction
6. ✅ Cancel drawing with Escape key
7. ✅ Lines grouped by width in table
8. ✅ Delete line with Delete button
9. ✅ Delete line with Delete key
10. ✅ Table updates when line is deleted
11. ✅ Adjust line width with bracket keys
12. ✅ Scale display in sidebar header
13. ✅ Length formatting in imperial units
14. ✅ Canvas size adjusts when sidebar toggles
15. ✅ Multiple lines with different widths
16. ✅ Real-time table updates
17. ✅ Empty state handling

**Configuration:**
- Playwright config: `playwright.config.ts`
- Test scripts in `package.json`
- Screenshot on failure
- Trace on retry
