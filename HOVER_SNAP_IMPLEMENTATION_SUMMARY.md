# Hover Snap Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Feature Overview

**Implemented**: Magnetic snapping indicator now appears **immediately** upon entering drawing mode, allowing users to snap the starting point of a new line to existing geometry **before** clicking the first point.

### Previous Behavior
- ❌ Snapping only activated **after** clicking the first point
- ❌ No visual feedback when hovering before starting to draw
- ❌ Users couldn't see snap points until they were already drawing

### New Behavior
- ✅ Snapping activates **immediately** when entering drawing mode (press 'D')
- ✅ Cyan snap indicator appears when hovering near existing geometry
- ✅ Users can see and snap to endpoints/midpoints/lines **before** clicking
- ✅ Snap indicator disappears when exiting drawing mode

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Analysis ✅
**Completed**: Analyzed current snapping implementation

**Findings**:
- `onPointerMove` had restrictive conditions: required `drawingPhase === 'waiting-for-end'`
- `snapTarget` state was only updated during active drawing
- Render function already supported displaying `snapTarget` (no changes needed)
- `onPointerDown` already used `findSnapTarget` (compatible with hover snap)

### Phase 2: Modify onPointerMove ✅
**Completed**: Updated pointer move handler for hover snapping

**Changes Made** (`src/DrawingCanvas.tsx` lines 504-523):
```typescript
const onPointerMove = useCallback((e: React.PointerEvent) => {
  const c = canvasRef.current; if (!c) return;

  // Enable snapping in draw mode (both idle and waiting-for-end phases)
  if (!isDrawActive) return;  // ← Simplified condition

  const rawPos = getPointerPos(c, e.nativeEvent as any);

  // Check for snap target
  const snap = findSnapTarget(rawPos, lines);

  // Update snap indicator for both hover (idle) and active drawing (waiting-for-end)
  setSnapTarget(snap);  // ← Now updates in both phases

  // Only update draft end point when actively drawing (waiting for end point)
  if (drawingPhase === 'waiting-for-end' && pendingStartPoint) {
    const endPos = snap ? snap.point : rawPos;
    setDraftEnd(endPos);
  }
}, [isDrawActive, drawingPhase, pendingStartPoint, lines]);
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Removed restrictive conditions (`drawingPhase !== 'waiting-for-end'`, `!pendingStartPoint`)
2. Now only checks `if (!isDrawActive)` - runs for both idle and active drawing
3. Always updates `snapTarget` when in draw mode
4. Preserves existing behavior for `draftEnd` (only updates when actively drawing)

### Phase 3: Update Snap Logic ✅
**Completed**: Ensured snap logic works for both phases

**Changes Made** (`src/DrawingCanvas.tsx` line 607):
```typescript
useEffect(() => { render(); }, [lines, pendingStartPoint, draftEnd, selectedId, snapTarget, render]);
```

**Added**: `snapTarget` to render dependencies to ensure real-time visual updates

### Phase 4: Verify onPointerDown ✅
**Completed**: Confirmed existing code works with hover snap

**Verification** (`src/DrawingCanvas.tsx` lines 440-450):
- ✅ Already calls `findSnapTarget(rawPos, lines)` when clicking first point
- ✅ Uses snap point if available: `const startPos = snap ? snap.point : rawPos`
- ✅ Sets `snapTarget` state to maintain visual indicator
- ✅ No changes needed - seamlessly integrates with hover snap

### Phase 5: Testing ✅
**Completed**: Implementation tested and verified

**Additional Changes** (`src/DrawingCanvas.tsx` lines 282-287):
```typescript
// Clear snap target when exiting draw mode
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isDrawActive) {
    setSnapTarget(null);
  }
}, [isDrawActive]);
```

**Purpose**: Ensures snap indicator disappears when exiting drawing mode

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Added automated test: `tests/drawing-canvas.spec.ts` (lines 272-313)
- ✅ Created manual test guide: `MANUAL_TEST_HOVER_SNAP.md`
- ✅ Verified in browser at http://localhost:5173/

## ✨ User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. Press 'D' to enter drawing mode
2. Move cursor (no visual feedback)
3. Click first point
4. **Only now** see snap indicator for second point

### After
1. Press 'D' to enter drawing mode
2. **Immediately** see snap indicator when hovering near lines
3. Click first point (with confidence it will snap)
4. Continue seeing snap indicator for second point

### Benefits
- 🎯 **Better precision**: Users can see snap points before committing
- 👁️ **Visual feedback**: Immediate indication of available snap points
- ⚡ **Faster workflow**: No need to guess where snap points are
- 🎨 **Professional feel**: Matches CAD software behavior

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test
**Location**: `tests/drawing-canvas.spec.ts` (line 272)
**Test Name**: "should show snap indicator immediately when entering draw mode (hover snap)"

**Test Flow**:
1. Enable draw mode
2. Draw initial line
3. Hover near endpoint (should show snap indicator)
4. Click to start new line (should snap)
5. Complete second line
6. Verify both lines created

### Manual Testing
**Guide**: See `MANUAL_TEST_HOVER_SNAP.md`

**Quick Test**:
1. Open http://localhost:5173/
2. Press 'D' to enter drawing mode
3. Draw a line (click-click)
4. Hover near the line endpoint
5. **Expected**: Cyan circle appears at snap point

---

## 📊 Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Snap calculation already existed, just runs earlier now
- **No additional loops**: Same `findSnapTarget` function
- **Optimized**: Only runs when `isDrawActive === true`
- **Efficient**: Uses existing `useCallback` memoization

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Implementation complete
- ✅ Code reviewed
- ✅ Tests added
- ✅ Documentation created
- ✅ Ready for production

---

## 📝 Notes

- The snap indicator is a cyan circle (color: #06B6D4)
- Snap thresholds remain unchanged:
  - Endpoints: 20px
  - Midpoints: 18px
  - Line segments: 15px
- Feature works with keyboard shortcut ('D') and FAB button
- Snap indicator automatically clears when exiting draw mode

---
