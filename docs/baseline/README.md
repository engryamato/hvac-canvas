## üéØ Purpose of Baseline Documentation

### Why We Created This:

1. **Regression Detection**
   - Ensure refactored code behaves identically to original
   - Catch unintended changes early
   - Validate that all features still work

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Measure improvements in code organization
   - Track performance changes
   - Monitor test coverage growth

3. **Knowledge Preservation**
   - Document how the system works before changes
   - Capture tribal knowledge
   - Provide reference for future developers

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Define success criteria for refactoring
   - Establish performance budgets
   - Set coverage targets

## üéØ Refactoring Goals

### Code Organization Goals:
- ‚úÖ Break down 1,228-line file into ~45 modular files
- ‚úÖ Maximum file size: ‚â§200 lines
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (types, constants, utils, services, hooks, components)
- ‚úÖ Enforced dependency flow (components ‚Üí hooks ‚Üí services ‚Üí utils ‚Üí types)

### Test Coverage Goals:
- ‚úÖ Overall coverage: ‚â•80%
- ‚úÖ Utils/Services coverage: ‚â•80%
- ‚úÖ Hooks/Components coverage: ‚â•70%
- ‚úÖ Add 40+ new unit/integration tests
- ‚úÖ Fix failing E2E test

### Performance Goals:
- ‚úÖ Maintain bundle size within ¬±10% (< 176 KB JS)
- ‚úÖ Maintain build time within ¬±20% (< 773ms)
- ‚úÖ Maintain 60 FPS for all interactions
- ‚úÖ No performance regressions

## üìñ How to Use This Documentation

### For Developers:

1. **Before Making Changes:**
   - Read INVARIANTS.md to understand system behavior
   - Review USER_FLOWS.md to understand user interactions
   - Check TEST_BASELINE.md to see what's tested

2. **During Refactoring:**
   - Refer to INVARIANTS.md to ensure behavior consistency
   - Use VISUAL_BASELINE.md to verify UI unchanged
   - Run tests and compare against TEST_BASELINE.md

3. **After Refactoring:**
   - Verify all invariants still hold
   - Confirm all user flows still work
   - Check performance against PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md
   - Update REFACTOR_SCORECARD.md with new metrics

### For Reviewers:

1. **Code Review:**
   - Verify changes don't violate documented invariants
   - Check that user flows still work as documented
   - Ensure performance budgets maintained

2. **Testing:**
   - Run all tests and compare results to TEST_BASELINE.md
   - Verify no new failures introduced
   - Check that new tests added for extracted code

3. **Sign-off:**
   - Confirm all exit criteria met for phase
   - Verify scorecard updated with new metrics
   - Approve phase completion

## üîç Quick Reference

### Critical Behaviors to Preserve:

1. **Line Drawing:**
   - Click-click interaction
   - Snap to endpoint/midpoint/line
   - Minimum line length (2px)
   - Automatic selection after creation

2. **Zoom/Pan:**
   - Zoom centers on mouse cursor (wheel)
   - Pan with right-click drag
   - Zoom limits (10% - 1000%)
   - Reset view (Ctrl+0)

3. **Line Editing:**
   - Width HUD appears above selected line
   - Width range (1-60)
   - Keyboard shortcuts ([, ])
   - Delete with button or key

4. **Sidebar:**
   - Line summary grouped by width
   - Total length calculations
   - Collapse/expand toggle
   - Updates on line changes

### Critical Constants:

- **Zoom Factor:** 1.1 (10% per step)
- **Zoom Range:** 0.1 - 10.0 (10% - 1000%)
- **Snap Thresholds:** 20px (endpoint), 18px (midpoint), 15px (line)
- **Min Line Length:** 2px
- **Width Range:** 1-60
- **Sidebar Width:** 320px
- **Bottom Bar Height:** 60px

### Critical UI Elements:

- **Canvas:** White background, fills available space
- **Draw Button:** Fixed bottom-right, 56x56px, blue when active
- **Width HUD:** Positioned above selected line, semi-transparent white
- **Sidebar:** 320px width, right side, collapsible
- **Bottom Bar:** 60px height, bottom, zoom controls

## üìù Maintenance

### Updating Baseline Documentation:

**When to Update:**
- ‚úÖ After Phase 0 completion (initial baseline)
- ‚úÖ If intentional behavior changes approved
- ‚úÖ If new features added
- ‚úÖ If performance budgets adjusted

**What NOT to Update:**
- ‚ùå During active refactoring (baseline is frozen)
- ‚ùå For bug fixes (bugs are not baseline behavior)
- ‚ùå For performance regressions (these are failures)

### Version Control:

- Baseline documentation is version-controlled in Git
- Tagged at Phase 0 completion: `baseline-v1.0`
- Any updates require approval and new tag

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Capture Visual Baseline:**
   - [ ] Take screenshots of all UI states
   - [ ] Record videos of user flows
   - [ ] Store in `screenshots/` and `videos/` directories

2. **Measure Performance:**
   - [ ] Run Lighthouse audit
   - [ ] Measure FPS during interactions
   - [ ] Measure memory usage
   - [ ] Update PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md with actual values

3. **Review and Approve:**
   - [ ] Team reviews all baseline documentation
   - [ ] Stakeholders approve baseline
   - [ ] Tag baseline in Git: `baseline-v1.0`

4. **Begin Refactoring:**
   - [ ] Proceed to Phase 1: Extract Types & Constants
   - [ ] Use baseline as reference throughout
   - [ ] Update scorecard after each phase
