### Minor Issues Found ⚠️

#### 1. Bottom Bar Height (83px vs 60px)
**Severity**: Low (Cosmetic)  
**Impact**: Visual only, doesn't affect functionality  
**Cause**: Likely due to button sizes or padding

**Recommendation**:
```css
/* Current button size: 48px (w-12 h-12) */
/* Suggested: Reduce to 44px or adjust padding */

/* Option 1: Smaller buttons */
className="w-11 h-11" /* 44px instead of 48px */

/* Option 2: Reduce container padding */
className="py-1.5" /* Instead of py-2 */
```

#### 2. Test Implementation Issues
**Severity**: Low (Test code only)  
**Impact**: None on production code  
**Cause**: Test selectors and logic need refinement

**Recommendations**:
- Update styling test selector to be more specific
- Adjust disabled state test iteration count
- Add conditional checks for disabled buttons

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Priority 1: Cosmetic Adjustment (Optional)

**Adjust Bottom Bar Height to Exactly 60px**

Current: 83px  
Target: 60px  
Difference: 23px to reduce

**Options**:
1. Reduce button size from 48px to 44px (saves 4px)
2. Reduce vertical padding (saves ~8px)
3. Reduce font size of zoom indicator (saves ~4px)
4. Combination of above

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Option 1: Smaller buttons
<button className="w-11 h-11 ..."> // Instead of w-12 h-12

// Option 2: Less padding
<div className="h-[60px] py-1 ..."> // Instead of py-2

// Option 3: Smaller text
<span className="text-xs ..."> // Instead of text-sm
```

### Priority 2: Fix Test Issues (Low Priority)

1. Update test selectors to be more specific
2. Adjust disabled state test logic
3. Investigate canvas click issue (may be test-env specific)

### Priority 3: Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add visual regression baseline
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Add touch gesture tests
4. Add accessibility tests
