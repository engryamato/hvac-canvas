## Verification Results

### Build Verification ✅

```
✓ 1398 modules transformed
✓ dist/index.html                              0.97 kB
✓ dist/assets/pdf.worker.min-dbcae78a.mjs  1,046.21 kB
✓ dist/assets/index-35ea2a4e.css              17.49 kB
✓ dist/assets/index-00e5b8d6.js              663.50 kB
✓ built in 1.07s
```

**Status:** ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL - No errors or warnings related to glassmorphism

### Code Search Verification ✅

Searched entire `src/` directory for remaining "glass" references:

**Results:**
- ✅ `src/main.tsx` - Commented-out import (correct)
- ✅ `src/types/drawing.types.ts` - "Fiberglass" material (unrelated)
- ✅ `src/constants/duct.constants.ts` - "Fiberglass" material (unrelated)
- ✅ `src/constants/design-tokens.ts` - CSS gradient properties named "glass" and "glass-border" (general utilities, not glassmorphism)
- ✅ `src/components/LinePropertiesModal/PropertiesTab/MaterialDropdown.tsx` - "Fiberglass" material comment (unrelated)

**Conclusion:** No active glassmorphism code references found. All remaining "glass" references are unrelated to the glassmorphism design system.

### CSS File Verification ✅

**Remaining CSS files:**
- ✅ `src/styles/styles.css` - Main styles (neumorphism)
- ✅ `src/styles/typography.css` - Typography (neumorphism)
- ✅ `src/styles/neumorphism.css` - Neumorphism design system (PRIMARY)

**Deleted:**
- ✅ `src/styles/glassmorphism.css` - REMOVED

---

## Design System Status

### Current Design System: Neumorphism ✅

**Active Components:**
- ✅ Neumorphic raised effects (sm, md, lg, xl)
- ✅ Neumorphic inset effects
- ✅ Neumorphic hover states
- ✅ Neumorphic active states
- ✅ Dual shadow system (light + dark)
- ✅ Base background color (#E0E5EC)

**Removed Components:**
- ✅ Glass tier 1 (Primary UI)
- ✅ Glass tier 2 (Floating elements)
- ✅ Glass tier 3 (Interactive controls)
- ✅ Glass PDF controls
- ✅ Glassmorphism dark mode variants

---

## Import Status

### Main Entry Point ✅

**`src/main.tsx`**
```typescript
import './styles.css'
import './styles/typography.css'
// import './styles/glassmorphism.css' // Disabled: Using neumorphism design system instead
import './styles/neumorphism.css'
```

Status: ✅ Correct - Glassmorphism import commented out, neumorphism imported

---

## Documentation Status

### Inventory Documents Updated ✅

- ✅ ARCHITECTURE_INVENTORY.md - Neumorphism as PRIMARY
- ✅ COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md - Neumorphism styling
- ✅ INVENTORY_SUMMARY.md - No glassmorphism tasks
- ✅ AUDIT_SUMMARY_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md - Production ready
- ✅ AUDIT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md - Production ready

### Historical Documentation Preserved ✅

- ✅ GLASSMORPHISM_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md - Kept for reference
- ✅ GLASSMORPHISM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Kept for reference
- ✅ NEUMORPHISM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md - Kept for reference
