## Issue #1: No Line Properties After Drawing 🔴 CRITICAL

### What I Expected
After drawing a line, I should be able to:
- Click the line to select it
- See a properties panel
- Edit width, material, gauge
- See calculated velocity and friction

### What Actually Happens
- I draw a line
- Nothing happens
- I can't edit it
- I can't see any properties

### Professional Impact
**CRITICAL** - This is the core functionality. Without this, I can't do any HVAC design work.

### Code Status
✅ LinePropertiesModal component exists  
✅ Modal logic implemented  
❌ Not wired to UI  
❌ Not triggered on line selection

---

## Issue #2: No HVAC Calculations Visible 🔴 CRITICAL

### What I Expected
When I select a line, I should see:
- Velocity (fpm)
- Friction loss (in.wc/100ft)
- Velocity pressure
- Recommended duct size

### What Actually Happens
- No calculations displayed
- No CFM input field
- No results panel

### Professional Impact
**CRITICAL** - This is the entire value proposition. Without calculations, this is just a drawing tool.

### Code Status
✅ Calculation functions exist (calculateVelocity, calculateFriction, etc.)  
✅ Service layer implemented  
❌ Not displayed in UI  
❌ No results panel

## Issue #4: PDF Upload Button Doesn't Work 🟡 HIGH

### What I Expected
- Click "Upload PDF"
- Select floor plan
- Draw HVAC lines over it

- Delete key to remove it

### What Actually Happens
- Can't select lines
- Can't move lines
- Can't delete lines
- Can't modify anything

### Professional Impact
**HIGH** - Design iteration is impossible. I need to be able to edit my work.

### Code Status
✅ Selection logic exists  
✅ Highlighting implemented  
❌ No edit mode  
❌ No delete functionality  
❌ No move functionality

## Issue #6: No Onboarding or Help 🟡 HIGH

### What I Expected
- Tutorial on first launch
- Tooltips on buttons
- Help menu
- Keyboard shortcuts list

### What Actually Happens
- No tutorial
- No tooltips
- No help

### Professional Impact
**HIGH** - Professional users expect clear guidance. The purpose of the tool is unclear.

### Code Status
❌ No onboarding  
❌ No tooltips  
❌ No help system  
❌ No keyboard shortcuts

---

## Issue #7: Unclear Purpose 🟡 HIGH

### What I See
- A beautiful drawing canvas
- Some controls
- A sidebar

### What I Don't See
- What makes this HVAC-specific?
- What can I actually do?
- What's the value proposition?

### Professional Impact
**HIGH** - Professional users need to understand what the tool does immediately.

### Code Status
❌ No value proposition visible  
❌ No HVAC features visible  
❌ No documentation  
❌ No examples

---

## Issue #8: No Error Handling 🟡 MEDIUM

### What I Expected
- Clear error messages
- Helpful feedback
- Status indicators
- Confirmation dialogs

### What Actually Happens

- No feedback
- No status messages
- No confirmations

### Professional Impact
**MEDIUM** - Professional users expect clear feedback on their actions.

### Code Status
❌ Limited error handling  
❌ No error messages  
❌ No user feedback  
❌ No status indicators

## Issue #9: No Keyboard Shortcuts 🟡 MEDIUM

### What I Expected
- Ctrl+S to save
- Ctrl+Z to undo
- Delete to remove
- Ctrl+A to select all

### What Actually Happens

## Professional Verdict

### Current State
**This is a beautiful prototype, not a production tool.**

### What's Needed
**Complete the core HVAC features and this becomes viable.**

### Timeline
**2-4 weeks to production readiness if features are integrated.**

### Recommendation
**Not ready for professional use. Complete feature integration first.**
