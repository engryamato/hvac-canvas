## üí° Key Insights

### Insight 1: Beautiful Foundation
The visual design and code quality are excellent. This is a solid foundation for a professional tool.

### Insight 2: Feature Gap
Core HVAC features are built but not integrated. This is the main blocker.

### Insight 3: Incomplete Product
The app feels like a well-designed prototype, not a finished product.

### Insight 4: High Potential
Once features are integrated, this could be a professional-grade tool.

## üéì Professional Recommendation

### Current Status
üî¥ **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

### Reason
Core HVAC features are not integrated into the UI. Professional users cannot use this for real work.

### Next Steps
1. Integrate Line Properties Modal
2. Display HVAC calculations
3. Implement save/export
4. Complete PDF upload
5. Implement line editing

### Timeline to Production
**2-4 weeks** if features are integrated and tested properly.

### Recommendation
**Complete feature integration before marketing to professional users.**
