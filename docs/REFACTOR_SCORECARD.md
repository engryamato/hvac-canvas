## 📊 Detailed Metrics by Phase

### Phase 0 Metrics (Current)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Created | 6 docs |
| Lines Documented | ~2,000 lines |
| Time Spent | ~2 hours |
| Issues Found | 1 (failing E2E test) |
| Baseline Established | ✅ Yes |

---

## 🚨 Issues & Risks

### Current Issues:

1. **Failing E2E Test** (Medium Priority)
   - Test: "should draw a line with click-click interaction"
   - Cause: Bottom bar overlaps draw button
   - Impact: Cannot test core functionality via this test
   - Fix: Adjust z-index or button position
   - Status: 🔴 Open

### Identified Risks:

1. **Phase 5 Complexity** (Medium-High Risk)
   - Extracting UI components is most complex phase
   - High risk of breaking visual layout
   - Mitigation: Extensive visual testing, incremental extraction

2. **Test Coverage Gap** (Medium Risk)
   - No unit tests currently exist
   - Large gap to fill (0% → 80%)
   - Mitigation: Parallel testing workstream

3. **Performance Regression** (Low Risk)
   - Refactoring could impact performance
   - Mitigation: Performance testing after each phase
