# Phase 4: Extract Custom Hooks - Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-09

   - Build time increased by only 41ms (6%)
   - All performance budgets maintained

4. **Excellent Documentation**
   - Every hook has detailed JSDoc comments

## 📝 Hook Architecture

### Dependency Flow
```
DrawingCanvas.tsx (UI)
    ↓
Custom Hooks (State Management)
    ↓
Services (Business Logic)
    ↓
Utils (Pure Functions)
    ↓
Types & Constants

### Hook Responsibilities

#### State Management Hooks
- **useDrawingState**: Drawing interaction state (2-click drawing flow)
- **useViewportTransform**: Viewport zoom and pan state

#### Side Effect Hooks
- **useCanvasSetup**: Canvas initialization and resize handling
- **useKeyboardShortcuts**: Keyboard event handling

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Hooks Simplify State Management**
   - Clear separation between state and UI
   - Easier to test state logic in isolation
   - Reusable across components

2. **React Testing Library for Hooks**
   - `renderHook` and `act` make hook testing straightforward
   - Tests verify React-specific behavior (re-renders, cleanup)
   - jsdom environment required for React hooks

3. **Service Layer Pays Off**
   - Hooks delegate to services for business logic
   - No duplication between hooks and components
   - Clean dependency flow maintained

4. **Zero Performance Impact**
   - Hooks are tree-shakeable
   - No bundle size increase until actually used
   - Build time impact minimal
