**Task Master AI** is now configured for your HVAC Canvas project! It's an AI-powered task management system that helps organize complex development work.

---

## ✅ Installation Complete

### What Was Set Up
1. ✅ **MCP Server Configuration** - `.cursor/mcp.json` created
2. ✅ **API Keys Configured** - OpenAI (primary) + Anthropic (fallback)
3. ✅ **Environment Variables** - `.env` file with model configuration
4. ✅ **Security** - `.cursor/` added to `.gitignore`
5. ✅ **Documentation** - Setup guide and codebase specs created

### Model Configuration
- **Main Model:** GPT-4o (OpenAI) - For primary task management
- **Research Model:** GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI) - For research tasks
- **Fallback Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic) - Backup if OpenAI fails

## 🚀 How to Start Using It

### Step 1: Restart Cursor
**IMPORTANT:** You must restart Cursor for the MCP server to load.

1. Close Cursor completely
2. Reopen Cursor
3. Open this project (`hvac-canvas`)

### Step 2: Verify Installation
After restarting, Task Master AI should appear in your MCP servers list.

### Step 3: Start Using It
In your AI chat (with me or any AI assistant in Cursor), you can now ask:

```
"Create a task breakdown for implementing the Line Properties Modal"
"Research best practices for canvas performance optimization"
"Plan tasks to add undo/redo functionality"
"Break down the export/import feature into subtasks"
```

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases for Your HVAC Canvas Project

### 1. Feature Planning
**You:** "I want to add undo/redo functionality to the canvas"

**Task Master AI will:**
- Break down the feature into subtasks
- Research undo/redo patterns for canvas apps
- Create implementation plan with dependencies
- Track progress as you complete tasks

### 2. Bug Fixing
**You:** "The snap detection is too sensitive, help me fix it"

**Task Master AI will:**
- Analyze the snap detection code
- Create tasks for investigation and fixes
- Suggest testing approaches
- Track the fix progress

### 3. Refactoring
**You:** "I need to refactor the DrawingCanvas component, it's too large"

**Task Master AI will:**
- Analyze the component structure
- Suggest refactoring strategies
- Break down into safe, incremental steps
- Help maintain test coverage during refactoring

### 4. Testing
**You:** "Improve E2E test coverage for the modal interactions"

**Task Master AI will:**
- Identify gaps in test coverage
- Create test scenarios
- Plan test implementation tasks
- Track testing progress

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### API Keys Location
Your API keys are stored in two places:
1. **`.cursor/mcp.json`** - MCP server configuration
2. **`.env`** - Environment variables (backup)

Both files are in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

### Model Selection
Task Master AI will use:
- **GPT-4o** for most operations (as you requested)
- **GPT-4o-mini** for lighter research tasks
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** if OpenAI is unavailable

You can change models by editing `.cursor/mcp.json` or `.env`.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Showing
1. ✅ Restart Cursor completely
2. ✅ Check `.cursor/mcp.json` exists and is valid JSON
3. ✅ Verify API keys are correct

### API Errors
1. ✅ Check API key validity
2. ✅ Verify you have credits/quota available
3. ✅ Check model names are correct
4. ✅ Try the fallback model

### Task Master Not Responding
1. ✅ Check Cursor's MCP server status
2. ✅ Restart the MCP server
3. ✅ Check console for errors
