# üîß CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - Missing Import

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: App was showing blank/white screen with error  
**Root Cause**: Missing import for `setupHiDPICanvas` function  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## The Problem

The app was displaying a **blank white screen** with the following error in the console:

```
ReferenceError: setupHiDPICanvas is not defined
```

This prevented the entire application from rendering properly.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### File: `src/DrawingCanvas.tsx`

The `setupHiDPICanvas` function was being **called** on lines 309 and 312, but it was **never imported**.

**Before (Lines 16-23):**
```typescript
import {
  screenToCanvas,
  getPointerPos,
  findSnapTarget,
  resolveSnapPoint,
  pixelsToInches,
  formatLength,
} from "./utils";
```

The import was missing `setupHiDPICanvas`.

---

## The Solution

### File: `src/DrawingCanvas.tsx`

**After (Lines 16-24):**
```typescript
import {
  screenToCanvas,
  getPointerPos,
  findSnapTarget,
  resolveSnapPoint,
  pixelsToInches,
  formatLength,
  setupHiDPICanvas,  // ‚úÖ ADDED
} from "./utils";
```

**Change**: Added `setupHiDPICanvas` to the import statement from `./utils`.

## Technical Details

### What is `setupHiDPICanvas`?

The `setupHiDPICanvas` function is defined in `src/utils/canvas/rendering.ts` and is responsible for:

1. **HiDPI Support**: Configures canvas for high-DPI (Retina) displays
2. **Device Pixel Ratio**: Applies `devicePixelRatio` scaling for crisp rendering
3. **Viewport Transform**: Applies viewport transformation matrix
4. **Canvas Sizing**: Sets canvas resolution to match CSS dimensions

**Function Signature:**
```typescript
export function setupHiDPICanvas(
  canvas: HTMLCanvasElement,
  transform: ViewportTransform
): void
```

### Where It's Used

The function is called in two places in `DrawingCanvas.tsx`:

1. **Line 309**: Initial canvas setup
2. **Line 312**: Canvas resize handling

Both calls are in the `useEffect` hook that handles canvas initialization and resize observation.

---

## Files Modified

- **src/DrawingCanvas.tsx** (Line 23)
  - Added `setupHiDPICanvas` to imports from `./utils`

---

## Testing Performed

‚úÖ **Build Test**: `npm run build` - Successful  
‚úÖ **Runtime Test**: App loads without errors  
‚úÖ **Visual Test**: Beautiful gradient and glass effects visible  
‚úÖ **Functional Test**: All controls responsive  
‚úÖ **Console Test**: No errors or warnings  

---

## Conclusion

This was a **simple but critical import issue** that prevented the entire application from functioning. The fix was straightforward: add the missing import statement.

**Result**: The application now displays beautifully with all the glassmorphism effects, radial gradient background, and professional design elements fully visible and functional.
